# OokOok

OokOok is a temporal content and data management system, allowing
sustainable, reproducible citation of scholarly works and resources.

The goal is to create a platform for dynamic scholarly projects based
on descriptive technologies such as HTML5, CSS, RDF, and Open Annotation.

For more information about the design, follow my blog posts at

Run script/ookook_server.pl to test the application.
